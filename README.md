# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub

Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through. See a word you don't understand? We've included an emoji ðŸ“– next to some key terms. Click on it to see its definition.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!

This course is using the :sparkles: open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). In some cases weâ€™ve made changes to the history so it would behave during class, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.

-------------------------------

Clone this repository:
` git clone https://github.com/saramammar/github-slideshow.git `

Navigate to the repository in your shell:
` cd github-slideshow `

Create a branch, use whatever name you like. Feel free to use the suggested name below.
` git branch my-slide `

Or Create a new branch by issuing the command:
` git checkout -b new_branch `

Push the branch to GitHub:
` git push --set-upstream origin <BRANCH-NAME> `

Check out to your branch:
` git checkout my-slide `

Merge the main branch into the add-experience branch. To ensure that you're working with an up to date copy of main, we'll use its remote tracking branch:
` git merge origin/main `

Stage your new file:
` git add _posts/0000-01-02-saramammar.md `

After adding the text, commit the change while providing a commit message:
` git commit -m "<YOUR-MESSAGE>" `

Push your new commit to GitHub:
` git push `

Check out to the main branch:
` git checkout main `

Ensure the main branch is up to date:
` git pull `

If you want to undo the last git pull:
` git reset --hard master@{"10 minutes ago"} `

Merge your branch:
` git merge my-slide `

Push the merged history to GitHub:
` git push `

Delete your the branch locally:
` git branch -d my-slide `

If you want to Delete the remote branch:
` git push origin --delete <oldname> `

-----------------------------------------

List all remote branches:
` git branch --all `

Switch to another branch (remote branch):
` git checkout -t origin/another-branch `

If you want to rename a branch while pointed to any branch:
` git branch -m <oldname> <newname> `

If you want to rename the current branch:
` git branch -m <newname> `

If you want to push the local branch and reset the upstream branch:
` git push origin -u <newname> `

Set the cache for 1 hour:
` git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=86400" `

List of configurations:
` git config -l `

Open git documentation on browser:
` git help config `

Reset git email:
` git config --global --unset user.email `
or
` git config --global user.email "" `

Edit configuration from your code editor:
` git config --global --edit `

-----------------------------------------

Create new local repo:
` git init `

To send file from staging area back to working directory (unstage): (If you "git add" file by mistake and you would like to reset it back)
` git reset head <file_name> `
or
` git restore --staged <file_name> `

----------------------------------------

Create github public key:
` ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<write your email here>" `
` cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub `
Then go to github => settings => ssh keys => add new => paste your key

To test public key authenticated successfully:
` ssh -T git@github.com `

----------------------------------------

Make alias:
` git config --global alias.<alias> <for this word> ` 
Ex.: ` git config --global alias.st status ` => git st instead of git status
